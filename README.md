## Description
It is an ecommerce dedicated to selling Funko Pop dolls. The products are classified according to category and "universe" to which the figure belongs to. 
## Built with
* HTML.
* CSS.
* JavaScript.
* React.
* React Router DOM: I chose to work with this components library to work with dynamic routing.
* Firebase: I decided to work with this service because this project did not have too many requirements and Firebase provides a quick and easy way to create a database.

## Extra Info
  - This was a 7 week long project built during the React Js course dictated by Coderhouse. Project goals included using the technologies learned during the course and familiarizing myself with React's features.
  - It is not meant to be responsive or aesthetic, as it's main focus was to implement React.
